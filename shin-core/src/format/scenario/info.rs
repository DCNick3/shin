//! Contains types for tables in scenario headers.
//!
//! These tables provide various kinds of metadata for different engine features. Most importantly, there is one table for each type of asset the game needs to load, serving as a reference to an asset file, together with some additional metadata that is always the same each time a particular asset is loaded. Each asset table is a [`Vec`] of *info items*, where an info item is a struct containing a filename and potentially additional data. The index into the [`Vec`] is known as the asset's **ID**: when the script needs to specify an asset to load, it will only specify this ID, and all other necessary information is obtained by looking up the info item stored at this index in the [`Vec`].
//!
//! For example, the list of pictures — static images used primarily as backgrounds — is represented by [`PictureInfo`], which is just a [`Vec<PictureInfoItem>`]. If the script needs a picture to be loaded, it will specify an ID, which is looked up in this [`Vec`]. Concretely, let us consider the example of the “This story is nothing but fiction” picture at the beginning of every Umineko episode. For the purpose of displaying this picture, the script ultimately contains a `LAYERLOAD` instruction with the ID `1012` as its argument. When that instruction is executed, the engine will look up the [`PictureInfoItem`] with index `1012` in the [`PictureInfo`] table. That [`PictureInfoItem`] will contain the information that the desired picture has the filename “TEXT001”. Consequently, the engine will know to load the asset file located at `picture/text001.pic`, and display its contents on the screen.
//!
//! In some cases, there are also cross-references between different asset tables, which are specified by ID as well. For example, a [`MovieInfoItem`] contains the ID of a picture to be shown after the movie finishes playing. In this case, the engine will first look up the [`MovieInfoItem`] in the [`MovieInfo`] table, then secondarily look up the [`PictureInfoItem`] in the [`PictureInfo`] table whose index corresponds to the `linked_picture_id` field in the [`MovieInfoItem`].
//!
//! Apart from the asset tables, there are also a few other data blocks for various game-specific features, such as the Picture Box (`cgmode`) and Music Box (`bgmmode`), or Umineko's character relationship grid (`chars`). These may be somewhat more freeform in structure than the simple tables listed above, and their corresponding entry structs often also contain IDs linking to other data tables, as explained above.
