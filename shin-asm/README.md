A library to parse an (obviously custom) text format of an SNR file and to generate with it an SNR file.

The design is, tbh, a bit too overcomplicated for what it does, ~~but I was having fun~~.

This, theoretically, allows to build a language server, and, maybe, even a full-blown SDK for authoring games for an
engine.

For now, though, the goal is creating SNR files for testing various capabilities of the engine. Hopefully this will also
achieve that once I add support for more commands.
